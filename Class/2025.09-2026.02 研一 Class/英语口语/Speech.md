## Hoilday:Carnaval de Veracruz

```
1 简介
Carnaval de Veracruz is one of the biggest, wildest, and happiest festivals in the world. Every year, this one‑week celebration fills the port city of Veracruz with music, laughter, and joy. Nearly a million people from all over the world come together — no matter their age, no matter their race, no matter their class, no matter their background — just to celebrate!
And that’s how the story begins…

2 开幕仪式
The carnival begins with the Burning of Bad Mood. People burn a puppet that represents sadness or bad feelings, symbolizing purification and a fresh start.
And Once the bad mood is gone, the party truly begins…

3 盛装游行
Throughout the week, parades and dances never stop. Floats move in sequence — ocean, history, and mythology — while comparsas, the dance groups, perform high‑energy salsa, cumbia, merengue, and other Latin rhythms.

4 核心活动：加冕仪式
One of the most anticipated events is the crowning of the carnival queen and king. The queen is chosen by popular vote, representing not only personal honor but also the spirit of the community.

5 美食
And of course, no festival is complete without food.
Food is everywhere. From Parroquia Coffee and Glorias sweets, to spicy shrimp, seafood rice, and shrimp empanadas. If I were there, I would eat, eat, eat… and guess what? Eat again!

6 总结
Finally, let’s remember what this carnival truly means
Carnaval de Veracruz is more than a party. It is a living tradition where music, dance, costumes, and food bring people together. It shows us that celebration is not only about joy, but also about identity and community. That is the true spirit of Mexico.

## Festival:Butterfly Migration Festival

```
	Next, we will introduce butterfly migration. 
	In Mexico, between Michoacán and Estado de México, lives one of nature’s most spectacular migratory phenomena: every autumn, millions of monarch butterflies travel over 2,500 miles, turning the forests into a living ocean of orange and black.
	From the journey, let’s look at their destination
	The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere, nicknamed "Forest of the Butterflies", has been part of the Unesco World Heritage Sites since 2008 and is considered one of the country’s most popular tourist attractions.
	Today, visitors simply walk the trails in silence, watching the branches bend under the weight of wings
	
	That's All. Thanks for you listening.
